## Version 2.0.0
- I migrated the whole project to use Jetpack Compose, the interface changes and overall updates will be easier now.
- Enhanced Lock/Unlock system, now with a 8 char restriction.
- Added support for sending noso from one or more locked addresses.
- Overall stability updates.
- Custom Alis support improved (it used to be partially broken).
- Changed the build yaml to produce the release version instead of debug version for releases (release version has better performance).
