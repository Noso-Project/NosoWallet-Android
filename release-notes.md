## Version 2.0.4
- As PoP is now deprecated, was removed from wallet as well.
- Changed visual indication when destination wallet for funds sendings is now valid (from a red checkmark to a red x).
- Changed the minimum fee to align with protocol.
- Added the date and time to order history (just new orders).
- Fixed issue when sending noso to custom address, now it works fine.
- Layout fix for QR/Copy buttons in small screens (still to test, let me know if doesn't work as expected).
