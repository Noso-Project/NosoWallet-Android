## Version 2.0.3
- Full PoP Support, but won't actually make you earn Noso until pools officially support it (You can use it to test your energy settings and stuff).
- Now password sent to pools is encrypted as MD5 for improved security.
- To enable/disable PoP wallet needed to be sync, now you can disable but not enable PoP if wallet is not sync.
- Added exact Hour:Minute of next participation in the notification (it is a random time between the next block start and end time).
- Textfield for password in PoPDialog will turn red if password is not long enough.
