## Version 1.0.12 
###IMPORTANT NOTE:
- This is the first release fully builded from github actions which implements a signing method to be used for github and in local building to have the same cert used so it will be helpful if in the future (Hopefully I'll be with you for much more time) someone else needs to take care of the repo
